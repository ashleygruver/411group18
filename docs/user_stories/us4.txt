When a color palette is selected either from the "Color Palettes Generated" button or immediately after being generated, we will see a menu showing the color palette from the playlist with the ability to share an image showing information on the playlist and color palette on various social media platforms after logging in on those platforms. For example, if we want to share my color palette to Instagram, we should be redirected to our Instagram account if we’re logged in and be able to share the picture that is generated from the app. If we try to share to any social media app that we’re not logged into, then we will be sent to the login page of that app. As a stretch goal, we also want to view a famous painting that has a similar color palette and see playlists from other users that have similar color palettes.
