When we log in again, we want to be able to view theirour previously generated color palettes by clicking on a "Color Palettes Generated" button. If we do not have any color palettes generated, then we should not have a blank screen and there should be a popup informing us of this and navigating us back to the main page. When we click on a previously generated color palette, we should have the ability to “refresh” the palette, where the application will regenerate the color palette to adjust for songs being added and/or removed from the playlist. If the playlist is refreshed and the playlist now has no songs in it, then an error message will appear saying that the playlist that we refreshed is empty, and the app will delete the playlist from the generated list. We can also manually delete generated playlists, which would remove the palette’s playlist from the generated list and place it back with the playlists that don’t have generated palettes.
