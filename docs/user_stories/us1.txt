We want to start uplaunch the web application and be greeted. WhenAfter we are greeted, we want to be able to login to our Spotify account to connect the web app andto our Spotify playlists. If we donâ€™t have a valid Spotify account, we should be told that we cannot login to the app. If our Spotify account is valid, we should be redirected to the home page, where we can see previously generated color palettes from previous uses of the application, and all of our other Spotify playlists as well.
