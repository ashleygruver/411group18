Our first idea is to create a web application that allows us to get the top five color schemes based on a user’s Spotify playlist. Firstly, a user would sign in to their Spotify account, and the web app would allow the user to choose a playlist. Then, we will make an API call to Spotify’s API to fetch all the images of the album covers and send that to Google Vision API to get the color data. After aggregating all of that data, we plan on showcasing the top five colors of their playlist. We plan on using the Spotify API and the Google Vision API for this potential project.

We will create a web application that will take all posts from linked social media accounts within a certain time period and run sentiment analysis on them. It will use the generated analysis to assign each person a relevant movie quote. This will involve each user signing in with one or more social media accounts, and we will use the APIs of those social media sites to get recent posts. We will use a public sentiment analysis API to achieve the sentiment analysis. We will also have to maintain a database of movie quotes with their assigned sentiments.
